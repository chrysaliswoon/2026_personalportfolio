# 2026_personalportfolio
2026 is a year of new possibilities and huge changes both personally and career wise, so what better way to kick start it off than to revamp my personal portfolio website.

Inspired by my recent obsession with the Demacia lore in League of Legends and my love of the Harry Potter aesthetic, I was inspired to create my portfolio website around that theme.

All of the assets in this project was generated by ChatGPT and inspired by existing work by various people all around the world.
